# ATF1504-FT232HQ Shield

This is a "hat" PCB that plugs onto an easily available FT232H board and provides a JTAG interface to ATF1504 CPLDs. It allows those ICs to be programmed and even to be reset when their JTAG interface has been disabled. There is also no warranty whatsoever. **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!**.
